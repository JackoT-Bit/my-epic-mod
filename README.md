# My epic and oh so legit Pizza Tower mod

Not a real one, that is.

### Dependencies  

[GCC Compiler](https://gcc.gnu.org)  
[Resource Tuner Console](http://www.heaventools.com/download-rtc.htm)  
[7zip Command-Line](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html)

### How to set up  

Copy *Resource Tuner Console* and its associated files into a new sub-folder named `rtc`.  
Next, copy `7z.exe` that was installed with 7zip to the base folder (not `7zFM.exe` or `7zG`)  

Once these are done and *GCC* is installed, run `build.bat` to compile it.  
The resulting build can be found in the `builds` folder, along with the associated timestamp.

A ZIP folder will also be generated in the same folder, with the build inside.
